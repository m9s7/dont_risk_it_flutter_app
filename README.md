# Dont_risk_it_flutter_app

An app made in flutter for calculating your chances of winning a battle in a game of RiSiKo!

Achieving this repo because app needs to be migrated to Android embedding v2, and a way of doing that is by creating a new app and copying code over to it [per flutter docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/android/androidx-migration)     
```
Warning
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Your Flutter application is created using an older version of the Android
embedding. It is being deprecated in favor of Android embedding v2. Follow the
steps at

https://flutter.dev/go/android-project-migration

to migrate your project. You may also pass the --ignore-deprecation flag to
ignore this check and continue with the deprecated v1 embedding. However,
the v1 Android embedding will be removed in future versions of Flutter.
